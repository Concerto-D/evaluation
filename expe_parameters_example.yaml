# Synthetic use case parameters. Will be "swept" by ParamSweeper (https://mimbert.gitlabpages.inria.fr/execo/execo_engine.html?highlight=paramsweeper#execo_engine.sweep.sweep):
#   - <uptimes>: schedules representing the uptimes and sleeping periods of the server and its dependencies
#   - <transitions_times>: transitions time of the reconfiguration actions for each components
#   - <waiting_rate>: for each reconf program, when reconf is blocked, percentage of mandatory time
#                     to be up before going back to sleep.  (leave it at 1 for MASCOTS)
#   - <id>: uniquely identify a combination of the previous parameters (used to repeat the same experiment multiple times)

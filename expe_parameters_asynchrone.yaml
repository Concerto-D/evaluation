# Infrastructure reservation. The synthetic use-case is executed on Grid5000 nodes that need to be

# Synthetic use case parameters:
#   - <uptimes>: file containing a draw of nodes uptimes and their durations. The name of the file describes the uptimes, example:
#     'uptimes-<nb_wakes_ups>-<wake_up_duration>-<nb_deps>-<min_overlap_percentage>-<max_overlap_percentage>.json'.
#   - <transitions_times>: file containing a draw of transitions times for the deps and the server:
#     'transitions_times-<min_transition_time>-<max_transition_time>-deps<nb_deps>-<id>.json'.
#   - <waiting_rate>: either 0, 0.5 or 1, percentage of the initial wake_up_duration that a node has to wait when blocked
#     before going back to sleep.
# Below is an example of a list of experiments.
